# giphy-api
This website utilizes the GIPHY API. Allows you to create a customizable list. When you click on a list item, it will pull the top ten GIFs based on the name of the list item. You can set GIFs aside by clicking "Add Fav" or delete a GIF by clicking on "Delete." You can add new list items by typing in the input and clicking on "Add." Your custom list will be saved in your browser so that when you come back to the page it will automatically populate only the list items that you added. You can also delete individual list items and they will be removed from you custom list. Click on "clear all" to remove all GIFs and all list items.
